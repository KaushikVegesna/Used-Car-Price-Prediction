HTML

The code defines an HTML structure for a web page.
It includes a title for the webpage, a linked stylesheet (style.css), and the heading "Car Price Prediction."
It displays a logo image (nttdata.png) within a <div> with the class logo.
There are two <form> elements within the page, both using the HTTP POST method. The first form doesn't have any visible content and appears to be incomplete or intentionally omitted in your snippet.
The second form captures input data related to the car attributes that might impact the price prediction.
Inside the second form, there are several <div> elements with the class input group. Each of these divs contains a label and an input field, allowing users to input values for various car attributes (such as model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, MPG, engine size, and make).
The input fields have attributes like id, name, and required, which are used to identify them and ensure required inputs.
At the end of the form, there's a "Predict" button that users can click to submit the form and initiate the price prediction.
Within the HTML template, there's conditional logic ({% if ... %}) that's likely meant to display the prediction result or error messages depending on whether the respective variable's prediction or error is available.
If there is a prediction available, a prediction box is displayed with the predicted result.
If there is an error, an error box is displayed with the error message.
