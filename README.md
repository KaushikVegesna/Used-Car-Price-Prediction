HTML

The code defines an HTML structure for a web page.
It includes a title for the webpage, a linked stylesheet (style.css), and the heading "Car Price Prediction."
It displays a logo image (nttdata.png) within a <div> with the class logo.
There are two <form> elements within the page, both using the HTTP POST method. The first form doesn't have any visible content and appears to be incomplete or intentionally omitted in your snippet.
The second form captures input data related to the car attributes that might impact the price prediction.
Inside the second form, there are several <div> elements with the class input group. Each of these divs contains a label and an input field, allowing users to input values for various car attributes (such as model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, MPG, engine size, and make).
The input fields have attributes like id, name, and required, which are used to identify them and ensure required inputs.
At the end of the form, there's a "Predict" button that users can click to submit the form and initiate the price prediction.
Within the HTML template, there's conditional logic ({% if ... %}) that's likely meant to display the prediction result or error messages depending on whether the respective variable's prediction or error is available.
If there is a prediction available, a prediction box is displayed with the predicted result.
If there is an error, an error box is displayed with the error message.


CSS
1. **General Styling:**
- The `body` element has a background color of `#162447` (a deep blue) and a text color of white. It uses Arial or sans-serif font, has no margin or padding, and is centered in terms of text alignment.
  
2. **Container Styling:**
- The `.container` class styles the main content container. It has a maximum width of 600px, centered marginally, a light blue background color (`#CBF6FF`), rounded corners (5px border-radius), padding, and a subtle box shadow.

3. **Heading Styling:**
- The `h1` elements have their default margin-top removed, and the text color is set to white.
  
4. **Input Styling:**
- The `.input-group` class styles each group of label and input. It adds a margin at the bottom.
- Label elements inside `.input-group` have a specific width, are right-aligned, have a small margin to the right, and use black text color.
- Input elements of type text and number have a width of 200px, padding, a border, and a light blue background color. They use black text color.

5. **Button Styling:**
- The `.input-group button` styles the submit button. It has padding, blue background color (`#3366cc`), white text color, no border, rounded corners, and a pointer cursor on hover.

6. **Result Box Styling:**
- The `.prediction-box` class styles the box that displays prediction results. It has a light gray background color, a light border, rounded corners, padding, and a margin at the top.
- Inside the prediction box, `h2` and `p` elements are styled with specific text colors and margins.

7. **Error Box Styling:**
- The `.error-box` class styles the box that displays error messages. It has a light red background color, a red border, rounded corners, padding, a margin at the top, red text color, and an increased font size.

8. **Logo Styling:**
- The `.logo` class styles the logo image. It's positioned absolutely at the top right corner (20px from the top and 20px from the right), has a specific width (200px), and maintains its aspect ratio with `height: auto`.

These styles collectively give a consistent and visually appealing appearance to the car price prediction web page, with specific attention to layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
